## Getting Started

Biometric Web - `Capture SDK` is intended to be used by service providers to build identity proofing services for their end-users.

Biometric Web Capture SDK is a ***JavaScript SDK*** *hosted* within a ***backend*** server. This SDK brings face and liveness detection from video streams.

The main services are:

-   Acquiring a best-image from a video stream
-   Performing a liveness check to verify that the acquired FACE is genuine - not a photocopy, not a video, not a mask

This SDK **is not** a set of tools to **download** but rather **javascript files** to be ***integrated into a client web application***.

To include the javascript files in the main html page of the client application, for each javascript file, use a ***script *tag*** in the ***html head*** and set the **`scr` attribute** to the ***.js file location***.

As an integrator, you can follow the three steps  below (~15 minutes) to test and use Biometric Web Capture SDK through our Sample client application.

### Step 1: Requirements

**Required systems:**

- Linux or Windows OS

- Memory: At least 8GB of RAM

-	CPU: CPU 2.5 GHz

**Required services:**

To facilitate integration with the Biometric Services SDK, we provide a web application in source code as an integration good practice example.

This sample application is developed in Nodejs. To use it, install Nodejs:

-   Linux: Download & install https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.1/node-v8.11.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
-   Windows: Download & install https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.1/

In order to start the integration, you need an API key and a sandbox environment. You can obtain these by registering yourself through https://developer.idemia.com/signup/.

Within the dashboard `API_KEY`, the required values are:

   * `Address`: the backend URL
   * `WEBBIO-VIDEO API Key`: the APIKEY value

### Step 2: Sample Application Deployment

1. Download the latest sample web application from github repository https://github.com/idemia/WebCaptureSDK.

2. Unzip the archive and go to the root folder.

3. Edit the file '/server/config/default.js' and update the configuration variable to set your environment (credentials and Biometrics Services url).

4. Add your API key by filling the `WEB_SDK_LIVENESS_ID_DOC` value.

5. Modify Biometric Services with your `Address` (see `Address` value in https://developer.idemia.com/dashboard/capturesdks/secrets/api-keys): `BIOSERVER_CORE_URL` for the Biometric API and `BIOSERVER_VIDEO_URL` for the Biometric Capture SDK.

   ```shell
   BIOSERVER_CORE_URL: 'https://XXXXXXXXXX/bioserver-app/v2',
   BIOSERVER_VIDEO_URL: 'https://XXXXXXXXXX',
   ```
6. Create a TLS [keypair and certificate](./server/config/certs/README.md): You can also convert an existing key/certificate in PEM format into PKCS#12 file format, or use an existing one. Then fill the values in 'server/config/defaults.js' with the corresponding location and password. Example:

   ```shell
   TLS_KEYSTORE_PATH: path.join(__dirname, 'certs/demo-server.p12'),
   ```
   ```text
   Put the password of the keystore within secrets/tls_keystore_password.txt
   ``` 


### Step 3: Run and test the sample application

Open a terminal to the root folder and:

* launch 'npm install' to load the dependencies

* launch 'npm start' to run the sample application

Now you can open a browser and run https://localhost:9943/demo-server/. For the best quality, use a smartphone connected through the same network without the firewall
https://`IP_ADDRESS`:9943/demo-server/.

#### Use Case #1: only biometrics are required

The provided sample is ready to be used. No further modifications are required.

#### Use Case #2: integration with the ID&V global offer to benefit of all service

If you want to link Biometric Services with ID&V/GIPS, edit the file `/server/config/default.js` and update the variables as follows:

-	set `IDPROOFING` to `true`

-	set `GIPS_URL` to the url you received

-	set `GIPS_RS_API_Key` with the API key header to use

-	set `GIPS_API_KEY_SECRET` with your API key value

| **Variable**       | **Description**    | **Value**       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| LIVENESS_MODE   | The liveness capture mode. Determines the type of capture and liveliness control to be performed on the video stream. | Allowed values: `LIVENESS_PASSIVE`: liveness check without challenge   `LIVENESS_MEDIUM`:  liveness check with « move the head » challenge. `LIVENESS_ACTIVE`: liveness check with « join the dots » challenge. |
| LIVENESS_ACTIVE_NUMBER_OF_CHALLENGE | Number of dots generated for « join the dots » challenge.  Only applies when `LIVENESS_MODE` is set to `LIVENESS_ACTIVE` | `2`              |

| :-------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| LIVENESS_SECURITY_LEVEL | recommended value: `HIGH` for convenience  or `VERY_HIGH` for security | `HIGH`, `VERY_HIGH`, `VERY_HIGH2`, and other values are not recommended |

#### Other Configuration Variables

| **Variable**    | **Description**    | **Value**    |
| ---------------- |------------------|-------------|
| DEBUG    | The `DEBUG` environment variable is then used to enable logs based on space or comma-delimited names. | front:app     |
| DISABLE_CALLBACK   | Disables the callback functionality from WebBioServer | `true`          |
